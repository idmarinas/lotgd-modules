        paragraph: >
            `3You stroll down to the shore of this strange island.
            In the distance, you can just make out the dark outlines of another land.
            Nearby, you can see the discarded tools left here by another adventurer, along with some wooden planks and some heavy twine.
            It occurs to you that these materials would make an excellent raft, which you could use to leave this place.`0

    raft:
        title: 'The Raft'
        paragraph: >
            `#Without further thought, you set about crafting your raft.
            The task is quickly accomplished, and with steadfast determination, you float the tiny barge, set foot in it, and push off shore.
            You drift from the shore slowly at first, toward darker waters.
            As you approach the obvious dropoff from the island, you feel your small craft begin to build up speed.
            It seems as if a strong current has you in its grasp, and is ushering you rapidly toward the ever growing shadow that is the land you could see from shore.
            `n`nSoon, you are caught in the shadow of the mighty land, and looking back you can barely make out the distant speck of soil where you started.
            At first you are gleeful that your raft has served its purpose so well, but soon you begin to worry as the stormy shoals of this new place loom upon you.
            Regretfully you did not build in any navigational means, and just as you near the shore, a mighty wave lifts you and your craft, slamming you against the beach with a mighty, plank-shattering thud.
            `n`nYou lay in the sand, dazed and bleeding for a while.
            As your short life begins to flash before your eyes, you notice a pair of eyes you do not recognize interfering with the visions.
            Slowly, your head begins to clear, and you realize the eyes belong to a beautiful woman who is leaning over you.
            You look around.
            Your surroundings are no longer the beach where you landed, but instead a small hut.
            Looking down, you realize your wounds have been bandaged, and your head is now clear of the death haze that once surrounded it.
            `n`nWith much effort, you try to thank the woman for saving your life, but she places her fingers on your lips to silence you.
            The effort to speak was all you could handle, and you soon pass into unconsciousness again.
            `n`nYou wake, and an unknown amount of time has passed.
            Looking around again, you discover that your surroundings have once again shifted.
            You now lay on a soft mat with a feather pillow in a forest.
            Nearby, you can hear the sounds of a village, and you feel as though much strength has come back.
            Getting up from your mat, you are ready to take on the world once more.`0

        title: Golinda
        paragraph: >
            `^Clutching your side, you fall to the ground, the world dimming around you.
            Just as the last motes of light fade from your vision, a bright yellow light comes upon you.
            You feel yourself lifted from the ground, now weightless, to stare at a tiny fairy who flits just in front of your face.
            "`#My, aren't you a silly one?
            Why did you let yourself get so beat up?
            Don't you know that if a creature is too tough for you, you can run away?
            `n`n`^"`0Well, in any event, you should be more careful from now on.
            I've brought you back from the brink of death, and I'll watch over you for as long as you reside on this island.
            But be careful, one day you will want to set forth from this place, and when you do, I will no longer hold any power.
            Other lands are the domain of {deathOverlord}, Overlord of Death`0, and his favor is not so easily found as mine.
            Please do be careful.
            I recommend that you visit the healer and get fixed up before you try fighting anything in the forest again.`^"`0
            `n`nWith that, the tiny fairy winks out of existence, and you feel gravity once again begin to pull at your feet.
            As the bright light fades from around you, you find yourself standing in the village square on wobbly knees once again.`0

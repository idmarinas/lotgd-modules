        explain:
            - '`n`nChronospheres essentially allow you to save up game days for later play, simply by not logging in.'
            - 'As you can see, you have {days,plural, =1{1 Game Day saved} other{# Game Days saved}} up, out of a maximum of {slots,number}.`n`n'
        donators:
            - 'Site supporters have several extra options.'
            - 'As a site supporter, you can instantly start a new Game Day for your character at any time in exchange for {buyDayCost,number} Donator Points.'
            - 'You can also add more Chronospheres, allowing you to save up more days to play later.'
            - 'Each additional Chronosphere costs {buySlotCost,number} Donator Points, and come pre-filled.'
            - 'When adding Chronospheres, you have the option of refilling your empty Spheres for a discount cost of {fillSlotCost,number} Donator Points per empty Sphere.`n`n'
            - 'For game balance reasons, donators can only buy {maxBuyDay,plural, =1{1 Instant Game Day} other{# Instant Game Days}} per real game day.`n`n'
            - 'You currently have {donationPointsUnused,plural, =1{1 Donator Point} other{# Donator Points}} available.'

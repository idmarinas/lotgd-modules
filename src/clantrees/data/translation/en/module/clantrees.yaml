                Since he is busy talking to another customer, you take a quick look over his stock to see what is available.`n`n
                There seem to be three varieties of tree here - a rather small scraggly group near the entrance look cheap, but nasty.`n
                Near {salesman} himself are some very reasonably sized, and priced, trees which look quite pretty and would look great by the entrance to your hall.`n
                However, at the back of the enclosure, guarded by a brutish looking troll, are a couple of grand trees - one of these would be incredible, but they have a price tag to match.`n`n
                As you browse over the selection and decide which ones would be good to have, {salesman} finishes up with the customer and turns to you. Which tree will you have?`0`n`n
                `&Small, Scraggly Tree - `^5,000 Gold `0and`% 5 Gems`0.`0`n

                `@{salesman} nods at your request, and motions to his assistant `$Sktim`0 to take the little thing into your clan hall.
                He carries it one-handed and places it in a pot near your entrance.
                It looks very plain at the moment, and although even the Dwarves of your clan are taller than it, a sense of holiday spirit spreads through the Hall because of its presence.
                Now the members of your clan will have something to decorate - it needs tinsel and baubles to liven it up, as well as goodly time arranging it.`0

                `@{salesman} nods at your request, and motions to his assistant `$Sktim`0 to take the tree into your clan hall.
                Though he struggles a bit with the awkwardness of it, he eventually makes it through the entrance and places it in a goodly-sized pot to one side of the entrance.
                It looks very plain at the moment, but it's a decent size and a sense of holiday spirit spreads through the Hall because of its presence.
                Now the members of your clan will have something to decorate - it needs tinsel and baubles to liven it up, as well as goodly time arranging it.`0

                `@{salesman} nods at your request, and motions to his assistant `$Sktim`0 to take the tree into your clan hall.
                He takes one look at the leviathan which you ordered and goes to get backup. Within five minutes the trolls he gathered to help give up - it is too heavy.
                While you are wondering how to get the tree into the hall, a mage wanders by, lecturing his apprentices on the basics of levitation as they scurry after him.
                `$Sktim`0 quickly takes advantage of this, and within minutes the wizards are all helping move the tree into your hall for levitation practice.
                It looks very plain at the moment, but with the topmost branch scraping the ceiling a sense of holiday spirit spreads through the Hall because of its presence.
                Now the members of your clan will have something to decorate - it needs tinsel and baubles to liven it up, as well as goodly time arranging it.`0

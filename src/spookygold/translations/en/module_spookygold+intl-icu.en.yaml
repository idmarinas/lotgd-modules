            Having won this tremendous battle, the Bonemarrow Beast laying at your feet, you step forward to retrieve your prize, but you can't help but wonder if there are any more beasts lurking in the shadows.

            The beast stops short of killing you, but instead starts ripping your arms and legs open, crunching the bones and eating the marrow. All the while it is careful to keep you from dying, as it prefers to eat its meals from living prey.
            The pain is unbearable, and you pass out, with the image of the beast's drooling jaws still before your eyes.`n

description: >
    `b`c`@{village}, Home of the Trolls`0´c´b`n
    `2You are standing in a pile of mud, in the heart of a vast swamp.
    Around you are the fetid skin-covered hovels that trolls call home.
    Well actually, they call them 'ughrrnk', but that's a bit hard on the throats of non-trolls.
    Nearby some local peasants squabble over the rapidly decaying remains of the morning's hunt.
    Perched atop one of the huts, a badly scarred troll smears indescribable filth over his home's surface in an ill fated attempt to water proof it.`0`n

    `n`2You wander the village, picking your teeth with the tiny rib of one of your siblings.
    Flicking off a bit of shell that was still stuck to your skin, you watch as it skips several times across the muddy surface of the swamp before a small lizard jumps on it and begins to consume its nutrients.`0

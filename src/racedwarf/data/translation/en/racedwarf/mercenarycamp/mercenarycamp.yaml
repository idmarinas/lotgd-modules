            - '`5You are making your way to the Bestiarium deep in the bowels of the dwarven mountain stronghold.'
            - 'The sounds of a massive struggle echo off the hewn rock walls of the cavernous passageway.'
            - 'Scuffling is punctuated with the sounds of snarling and the impact of a heavy body slamming into another.`n`n'
            - 'As you round the corner you find yourself at the edge of an arena.'
            - 'Around the walls are carved out stalls which contain beasts of various shapes, sizes and abilities.`n`n'
            - 'In the arena, a `&white wolf`0 whose size equals that of a mountain pony is lunging towards a massive `~black bear`0.'
            - '`~The bear`0 on his hind legs stands as tall as an oak.'
            - 'It raises a paw as `&the wolf`0 leaps towards him, then with a movement so quick you nearly miss it, `&the wolf `5is batted away to fall on its side.'
            - 'Apparently enraged, `&the wolf`0 leaps snarling to its feet to prepare to lunge again.`n`n'
            - 'At that moment a stocky dwarf standing at the edge of the arena raises his finger and thumb to his mouth.'
            - 'A piercing whistle cuts through the air.'
            - '`~The black bear`0 lowers himself to all fours and shakes his body, then yawns.'
            - '`&The white wolf`0 pauses, then lays down with his tongue hanging in a pant.'
            - 'Its yellow eyes never leaving you as you walk towards the dwarf.`n`n'
            - '"`tGreetings, Dwalin!`0" you call out as you approach.'
            - '"`tI am in need of a beast to accompany me on my adventures.'

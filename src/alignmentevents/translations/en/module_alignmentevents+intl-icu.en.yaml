                An enchanted spider approaches you, and explains that it didn't mean to scare you, but it and it's friends are trying to learn to spin thread, and it is `%not`0 going well.`n

                yet held up slightly by a pile of rocks!`n`nThe boat is full of a worried looking crew, and they seem to notice you!`n`n
                `3 "`&Help! Help!`3"`^ they yell.`n

                `n`#You wander across a group of children playing in a tree.  They cry out in fear as a branch begins to break.
                It looks like one of them will fall!`n

            '04': >
                `n`QA huge lion comes crashing through the forest. You notice he's limping! Since you've never seen a limping lion before,
                you find this quite amazing.  He comes to within a couple of feet and raises his front foot and you see a large thorn sticking out of it.`n
                What are you going to do?
            '05': >
                `n`%You come up to an open patch in the forest and see a young explorer yelling for help.

            '06': >
                `n`!You are wandering through the forest when you happen upon a group of young children.
                They are sitting huddled up against a tree, their clothes ragged and torn. They look as if they haven't eaten in days.`n

                `&While you are wandering through the forest, you stumble upon an enormous herd of elephants!`n
                You notice that they are `%pink `&with `5purple `&dots all over them and are only the size of a small dog!!`n
                Are you going to help them by painting them the color of normal elephants?`n
                Or are you going to ignore them and be on your way?`n
                Or perhaps you will market their weirdness and make a profit?!`n
                What are you going to do?
            '08': >
                `&As you are wandering through the forest, you trip and fall flat on your face!`n
                Grumbling, you pick yourself up, only to find yourself looking right into the eyes of a `4Red Fox`&!
                Your heart begins to beat faster as the fox sniffs your face, teeth bared.
                Suddenly, the fox whimpers, and you see that it has been caught in a trap!
                `#What are you going to do?
                `&You could `@help `&the fox and get it out of the trap, or you could simply `6ignore `&it and be on your way.
                Then again, you could be `4absolutely evil `&and pick on the fox and tease it.

                `VThe forest seems especially quite today, you realize. You have been wandering through the woods for a good while,
                searching for creatures to release from this realm of existence. Suddenly, you hear the snap of a twig. Whirling around,
                you draw your weapon, eyes searching the foliage for the source of the intrusion upon your journey.`n`n
                Your fingers tighten around the weapon as a creature emerges from the shadows of the forest.`n`n`n
                It is a wounded deer! She has an arrow sticking out of her side and she is bleeding profusely.
                Her eyes plead with you, yet at the same time are full of fear, frightened at the weapon in your hand, but too injured to run.
                What are you going to do?`n`n`n
                You could `2help`0 the poor creature and heal its wounds.
                `n`nOR you could `6ignore`0 it and go on your way.
                `n`nOR, being the vile, cruel person you are, you could hurt the deer even more by torturing it.

                `jIt has been a long, difficult day, and you are walking around in the forest, wondering if you should kill any more of these creatures.
                You know that it'll be....wait...what's that up ahead?
                `n`nBlocking the path is a wagon, and something is wrong about it...
                `n`nYou notice that the wagon is uneven and the occupants are standing on the side of the road.
                Thinking you might benefit from this somehow, you go to find out what is going on.
                When you arrive, the people look at you, distress apparent in their eyes.
                They beg with you to help them with their wagon, which has broken off a wheel on its way to the market.
                Will you help them?

                `$As you are trudging wearily through the forest, you come across a little girl in a red cape.
                She is holding a basket and you can smell the food coming out of it, delictable, delicious, intoxicating...`n`n
                The little red caped girl is singing about going to her Granma's house.
                It clicks in your mind that there are several evil creatures in the forest...
                This is a chance to help out a small, weak being.`n`n

                `QThinking it might lead you to a bakery, you bend down and taste the `tcrumbs`0 before grinning happily.
                You continue to follow the trail, gobbling down the `tcrumbs`0. After a little while, the crumbs stop, and frowning, look up.
                The sight before you is astounding! It's a house made entirely out of candy!`n
                Drooling, you rush up to the house, reaching out to take a piece of the window...`n
                When suddenly you hear a scream! You peek inside the window to see two local village children locked in a cage!`n
                A woman stands over them, grinning hideously. The children are in trouble! What are you going to do?!
                Are you going to `2help`0 the children or `$hinder`0 them and help the witch?!

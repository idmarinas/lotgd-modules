            "`#Now, I'm here to help you get familiar with these realms, so you better listen close to what I've got to say.`0"`n`n
            You nod dumbly for a moment then give this being your attention.`n`n
            "`#Now,`0" it says," `#you're only young, and maybe you don't remember where you grew up. If you've never been in here before, choosing one of these is probably easiest!`0" He jumps about excitedly, waiting for your decision, and waves a list of suggestions in front of you.`n

            He buzzes about, before imparting, "`#Why not try one of these first, so you won't trip over your own shoelaces?`0"`n`n
            He holds a small scroll before you, embossed with small script, and awaits your decision.`n

    title: Help!

        `%`c`bHelp Me, I'm Lost!`b`c`n
        `@Feeling lost?`n`n
        `#Legend of the Green Dragon started out small, but with time it has collected many new things to explore.`n`n
        To a newcomer, it can be a little bit daunting.`n`n
        To help new players, the Central staff created Eibwen, the imp.
        He's the little blue guy who told you to buy weapons when you first joined, and helped you choose a race.
        But what happens next, where should you go, and what are all the doors, alleys, and shops for?`n`n
        First of all: The game is about discovery and adventure.
        For this reason, you won't find all the answers to every little question.
        For most things, you should read the FAQs, or just try them and see.`n`n
        But we recognize that some things aren't at all obvious.
        So while we won't tell you what everything does, we've put together a list of things that you might want to try first, and that new players commonly ask us.`n`n
        Please understand that these hints are spoilers.
        If you'd rather discover on your own, don't read any further.`n`n
        `%What are all those things in my Vital Info, and Personal Info, I'm confused?
        A lot of it you don't need to worry about for the most part.
        The ones you should watch carefully are your hitpoints, and your experience.
        Ideally, you should keep that hitpoint bar green.
        And beware if it begins to turn yellow, or worse still, red.
        That tells you that death is near.
        Sometimes running would be smarter than risking death.
        Perhaps there's someone close by who can help you feel better.`n`n
        Lower down is the experience bar, which starts all red, and will gradually fill up with white.
        Wait until it goes blue before you challenge your master.
        If you can't see a blue bar, you aren't ready yet!`n`n
        Looking for someone you know?
        The List Warriors area will tell you if your friend is online right now or not.
        If they are, Ye Olde Mail is a good way to contact them.`n`n
        What are gems for?
        Hang onto these and be careful how you spend them.
        There are some things that you can only obtain with gems.`n`n
        Have you been into {iname}, in {city}? Perhaps you'd like to try a drink, listen to some entertainment, or chat to people.
        It's also a good idea to get to know the characters in the {iname}, because they can be quite helpful to a young warrior.
        You might even decide that sleeping in {iname} would be safer than in the fields.`n`n
        Travelling can be dangerous.
        Make sure you've placed your valuables somewhere safe, and that you're feeling healthy before you leave.`n`n
        Hungry, tired, feeling adventurous, or looking for a pet?
        The Spa, the Kitchen, the Tattoo Parlor, and the Stables are all places you might want to visit.
        These things are just some of the shops in different towns.
        Some of them give turns, charm or energy, and some take it away.`n`n
        Where's the dragon?
        They all ask this.
        You'll see her when you are ready to fight her, and not before, and you will need to be patient and build your strength while you wait.`n`n
        `QIf you have any questions which are not covered in the FAQ, you may wish to Petition for Help - bear in mind that the staff won't give you the answer if it will spoil the game for you.
